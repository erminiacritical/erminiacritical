- ðŸ‘‹  Iâ€™m @erminiacritical
- ðŸ‘€ Hi Marko,
my problem is not solved.
I roasted yesterday only once seeing the ET / BT values on the display even in the presence of the MODBUS error.
Today I don't see the values and therefore I have to roast without curve and without RoR. I attach a list of errors and screenshots.
Where should I change? What should I change? Please help me
